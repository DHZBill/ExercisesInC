Our team were formed based on a common interest in graphics programming and distributed systems. 
First we chose Max as our scrum master because he had some similar experience before and would like to take this responsibility. 
Then we talked about what we had done before and why we were interested in those topics. My interest in graphics originated 
from my CompArch final project last semester,where I explored on GPU and parallel programming, and my experience in CompNet 
can help our team if we are settling down on distributed systems. During the week we split into 2 subgroups and did research on 
graphics and distributed systems. Jeremy and I looked at CUDA, openGL and openCL, but we were unable to decide which to focus on.
Rachel and Max worked on distributed systems, and found out that it's really hard to build such a system in this project. In 
addition, since I have already learned a lot in CompNet, and knowing that it's not a easy job,we decided to focus more on graphics 
programming, and leave distributed systems as a stretch goal. Once we have decided on the topic, we then tried to specify our project. 
Given Allen's advice, we split into subgroups again, with 2 of us looking for online courses related to our topic, and the other 2 of 
us looking for interesting projects from the past. We put these tasks into our sprint backlog and will be talking about this next 
meeting. One thing I'm still apprehensive about is how can we scale the project well. We will keep exploring on this and try to set an
MVP and final stretch goal for our project.
