#Reflection 1

##Sprint Reflection

After we decided on our MVP and stretch goals, we started to look at introductions to ray tracing. All of our team member went through
several documents together, and we all got a common sense of what we needed to do to build our ray tracer. We learned about different 
algorithms to implement intersection, reflection and refraction etc. Now I'm clear about the components we need to build the ray tracer,
and how to build them in math. However, none of us has C programming experience, which made it hard for us to start writting code effectively.
And also, we did not do well in the reading question part of sprint review, because we focused more on researching on our project but did not
pay enough attention to the exercises and readings. Then we realized that we should do more exercise and treat the readings more seriously.
Now we all did the exercises and that made us easier to proceed to work on our project. Talking about our team, we are doing fairly well at the
beginning of this project, but I think by having more daily stand ups and more communications, we will do better and more efficiently as a team.

## Exam question:

What would the following function output?

```C
int main(){
    printf("%d\n",sizeof(printf("Hello")));
}
```
### Answer:

4

Explanation: the value inside sizeof() is not printed because sizeof() evaluates the size of the integer.
